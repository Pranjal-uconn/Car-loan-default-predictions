## Project Overview
Car Loan Default Predictions is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a borrower will default on their car loan. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict defaults based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about borrowers, loan details, and repayment history. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before being used for model training.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Pranjal-uconn/Car-loan-default-predictions.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Car-loan-default-predictions
    ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. Open and run the notebooks in the repository to see the data analysis, model training, and predictions.

## Model
The project explores various machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are performed to select the best model.

## Results
The results of the model predictions are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The performance of each model is compared, and the best model is selected based on these metrics.
